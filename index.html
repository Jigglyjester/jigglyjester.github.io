<p>The Luna Wolves were one of the original twenty Space Marine Legions in Warhammer 40,000, 
    led by the <strong>Primarch Horus</strong>. Known for their tactical brilliance and fierce loyalty, 
    they were among the most respected legions in the Imperium. After Horus was named Warmaster, 
    the Luna Wolves were renamed the Sons of Horus, signifying their close ties to him. 
    Ultimately, their legacy was tarnished by Horus's betrayal during the Horus Heresy, 
    which marked the beginning of a civil war that nearly destroyed the Imperium.</p>
